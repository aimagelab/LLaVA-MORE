## Overview

```LLaVA-MORE``` is a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures.

To further support the research community in enhancing Multimodal LLM performance, we are also releasing the training code and scripts for distributed training.

Remember to star the repository to stay updated on future releases ðŸ¤—!

## Performance
In this section, we present the performance of our model compared to other versions of LLaVA across different multimodal datasets.

## Installation
To create the conda environment named ```more``` use the following instructions.
With this environment you will have all the packages to run the code in this repo. 
```
conda create -n more python==3.8.16
conda activate more
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that the requirements are heavily inspired by the original [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA.git) repo.

## Training
To help the community in training complex systems in distributed scenarios, we are publicly releasing not only the source code but also the bash scripts needed to train ```LLaVA-MORE``` on HPC facilities with a SLURM scheduler.

To further extend the reproducibility of our approach, we are also releasing the [wandb logs](https://api.wandb.ai/links/aimagelab/kq668y5l) of the training runs.

**Pretraining**

``` bash
sbatch scripts/more/11_pretrain_llama_31_acc_st_1.sh
```
**Finetuning**
``` bash
sbatch scripts/more/12_finetuning_llama_31_acc_st_1.sh
```

### Visual Backbones

As mentioned before, ```LLaVA-MORE``` introduces the use of LLaMA 3.1 within the LLaVA architecture for the first time. However, this repository goes beyond that single enhancement.
We have also incorporated the ability to use different visual backbones, such as SigLIP, and various methods for managing image resolutions (S2).

Considering that, you can view this repo as an effort to expand the study of Multimodal LLMs in multiple directions and as a 
starting point for enhancing new features to improve the connection between images and language.

You can find more references in this folder: ```scripts/more```.


## Inference
You can try our ```LLaVA-MORE``` with LLaMA 3.1 in the Image-To-Text task using the following script.
``` python
source activate more
cd local/path/LLaVA-MORE
export PYTHONPATH=.

# tokenizer_model_path
export HF_TOKEN=hf_read_token
export TOKENIZER_PATH=aimagelab/LLaVA_MORE-llama_3_1-8B-finetuning 

python -u llava/eval/run_llava.py
```
If you get out-of-memory problems, consider loading the model weights in 8 bit (```load_in_8bit=True```).

## Acknowledgments
We thank the [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA.git) team for open-sourcing a modular codebase to extend and train different models within the LLaVA family.
We are also happy users of the [lmms-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval.git) library, which has significantly reduced the evaluation time of our checkpoints across different datasets.

We also thank [CINECA](https://www.hpc.cineca.it/systems/hardware/leonardo/) for the availability of high-performance computing resources used to train ```LLaVA-MORE```. This work is supported by the PNRR-M4C2 project [FAIR - Future Artificial Intelligence Research](https://fondazione-fair.it/) and by the PNRR project [ITSERR - Italian Strengthening of Esfri RI Resilience](https://www.itserr.it/).
